# Hooks

This directory is kept for compatibility with the upstream `rjs/shaping-skills` project.

The script here (`shaping-ripple.sh`) is for **Claude Code** hook integration.
I mainly use **Codex**, and Codex does not currently use this hook flow.

If you use Claude Code, you can still wire this script as a post-edit reminder.
